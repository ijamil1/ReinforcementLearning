# ReinforcementLearning
This repo will contain scripts and notebooks in which I explore and implement common RL algorithms on agents operating in Gym enviroments

Tabular_SARSA: got a tabular SARSA implementation working (kind of) on the Mountain Car environment

Tabular_QLearning: implemented a Vanilla tabular version of Q-Learning on the Acrobat environment; works relatively well

Function_Approximation_SARSA: implemented SARSA with function approximation on the Mountain Car environment. The function I used was a linear function and the state-action pairs were transformed into features using tile coding.
